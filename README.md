# Bruker OPUS Reader

## Introduction
The brukeropusreader Python package enables reading the binary OPUS files generated by Bruker spectrometers.

## Installation
~~### Install with pip~~
~~```pip install brukeropusreader```~~
This fork is not on pip, so you should manually install it. You can do so by adding a copy to or a symlink of the brukeropusreader folder to your Python's Lib\site-packages folder.

## Usage
Initializing `OpusData` parses OPUS file and returns `OpusData` object:
```
from brukeropusreader import OpusData

opus_data = OpusData('opus_file.0')
```

`OpusData` is a dict consisting of all fields found in opus file:
```
print(f'Parsed fields: '
      f'{list(opus_data.keys())}')

print(f'Absorption spectrum: '
      f'{opus_data["AB"]}'
```

For full code see [example](example.py).
